title: Google Foo-Bar 
---

Posting after a looong time because today was different.My Semester break is going on and my usual days involve a lot of coding that may be for a project or for competitive programming as well.
So coming to today ,I started with usual coding for one of my ongoing projects, but I was getting stuck a lot more than usual.
What did I do? The same thing everyone else does : "Google!". 

After hours of finding for stuff, the Invitation for <b>Google Foo Bar</b> comes up, asking If I was up for a challenge? 
And damn I was!

#### For those who don't know what is Foo Bar?

<b>Foo Bar</b> : It has 5 levels with increasing difficulty and solutions are only accepted in python or java.It has a console type 
of appearance and accepts some limited commands as well.One can take up 72 hours to solve a challenge.This is supposed to secret
recruitement process of Google and it can land you in a Google Interview.

Do I have a Google Interview in hand? (Man! Do I really? Me?) :open_mouth:

Anyways,
I have completed level 1 and half of level 2.Things are starting to get a bit difficult now.:sweat:

That's it for now, I'll keep updating!

<b> Thanks for reading </b>
