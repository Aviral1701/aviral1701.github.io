title: SDSLabs Winter of Code '16 Experience 
---

About a month ago, when my idea of open source projects was bleak, SDSLabs came up with Winter of Code program (SWOC). I realised that this could be my first venture in the world of open source programming.

Scrolling through their Github page, I stumbled upon the project called [Curvy]https://github.com/sdslabs/Curvy -a multiplayer game, going through its code was at first difficult for me(as this was the first time, i was reading someone else’s code), but gradually I got a hang of it. I prepared my proposal for the project and made two PRs on the original project to get the momentum going for the upcoming selections.

The results were out and my proposal was selected. I forked and started working on the project. First half of the program presented me with alot of challenges as it included designing a totally new gameplay for single player. I passed the mid-term evaluation successfully and now it was time to complete the rest of the project.

I made my last commit on the project  on 1st Jan’17.And soon the results[] came out and my project was marked passed. In all, I really enjoyed this experience and have learnt alot from it. Special Thanks to my mentor [Tanmay]https://github.com/tnmy44, for guiding me through the project and for invaluable suggestions and his semantically correct coding (which made my life easier).A big thanks to SDSLabs Team for putting up such a innovative event.

This was the story of my first stepping stone in the Open sourceworld, I hope there is alot more for me to contribute!
